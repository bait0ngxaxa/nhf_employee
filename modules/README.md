# Feature modules

`modules/` is the ownership boundary for business capabilities in the NHF
Employee application.

Phase A creates this boundary without moving any existing Stock, Routine,
Leave, Employee, or other feature implementation. Legacy locations remain
valid until a feature is deliberately migrated.

Rules for new work:

- Put a substantial new business feature under `modules/<feature>/`.
- Expose the supported external contract from `modules/<feature>/index.ts`.
- Treat everything below a module's public entry point as internal
  implementation.
- A module may depend on `shared/` and may consume another module only through
  that module's public entry point.
- Keep the structure proportional to the feature. See
  [module boundaries](../docs/architecture/module-boundaries.md) for the
  larger and smaller module shapes.

The intended dependency direction is documented in
[dependency rules](../docs/architecture/dependency-rules.md). Run
`npm run architecture:check` when changing code under this directory.
